# Chatbot
A cool UI to a bot that uses natural language processing (NLP) models to generate responses. The UI beginned with ol' HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and then got revamped into fresh React. The backend is powered by Python-flask using PyTorch for the NLP models.

## Features
<ul>
<li>Fluid animations that enhance the UI and user experience (not very bulky animation tho!).
<li>Professional design techniques and popular classic color palettes.
<li>Users can choose the color from a variety of accent colors to personalize the UI.
<li>Smooth scrolling effects ensure that the chat window always opens up to the last message sent/received.
<li>Messages include a timestamp (based on the user's local system set date and time ðŸ•–).
<li>Proper modular and reusable functions with understandable code :)
<li>Cross-browser and cross-device support for mobile, tablets, and PCs (It's responsive ðŸ’»).
</ul>
